*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program created a linked list using pointer and delete. 
It has functions to add and delete at the front and back. '
It also has functions that take in parameter and for the 
index and the data that user wants to add to the list. 
The list is created using a struct and a linked list class
which has all different functions to do so.

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  This is the driver program that calls sub-functions
   to read data from user, uses the data to call the linked list functions. 
Name:  LinkedList.h
   Contains the definition for the class LinkedList. Also has a struct.  

Name: LinkedList.cpp
   Defines and implements the LinkedList class for implementing a linked list using
   pointers. It contains functions to add or delete at the end and also contains 
   an ostream operation. This also clears the memory using linked list.

*  Status of program
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully on Visual studios but not on cse grid. 
    It gives me the error for "multiple definitions" and I don't know how to 
    fix it. I researched it online but it did not help much. Let me know how to
    fix this error for the future.   
   
   The program was developed and tested on Visual Studios g++.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.
